Please mark the corresponding letter for each item on Answer Sheet 2 with a single line through the centre. You may not use any of the words in the bank more than once.",
    "Passage": "Trust is fundamental to life. If you can't trust anything, life becomes intolerable. You can't have relationships without trust, let alone good ones. In the workplace, too, trust is 26 . An organization without trust will be full of fear and 27 . If you work for a boss who doesn't trust their employees to do things right, you'll have a 28 time. They'll be checking up on you all the time, correcting “mistakes” and 29 reminding you to do this or that. Colleagues who don't trust one another will need to spend more time 30 their backs than doing any useful work. Organizations are always trying to cut costs. Think of all the additional tasks caused by lack of trust. Audit (审计) departments only exist because of it. Companies keep large volumes of 31 because they don't trust their suppliers, their contractors or their customers. Probably more than half of all administrative work is only there because of an ever-existing sense that “you can't trust anyone these days.” If even a small part of such valueless work could be 32 , the savings would run into millions of dollars. All this is extra work we 33 onto ourselves because we don't trust people—the checking, following through, doing things ourselves because we don't believe others will do them 34 —or at all. If we took all that away, how much extra time would we suddenly find in our life? How much of our work 35 would disappear?",
