    "Passage": "If you’ve ever looked at the ingredients list while grocery shopping, chances are you’ve seen the term “natural flavors”. But have you taken a 26 to consider what these natural flavors actually are?Most of us might think that “natural flavors” are, well, naturally good for us. A recent study in the journal Appetite found that when the word “natural” appears on packaging, people 27 that the food within is indeed healthier. In truth, natural flavors do not 28 much, at least chemically speaking, from their flavor-boosting 29 : artificial flavors. Both can be made in a lab by trained flavorists, but artificial flavors use chemicals to give a product a 30 smell or taste.Natural flavors come from plant or animal 31 , like fruit, vegetable, meat, fish or milk that is then processed or refined in some way. In short, natural flavors are 32 from plants and animals to create specific flavors for processed foods. But that does not 33 make it easier to tell what is really in your food. Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not 34 the term, companies can use it to refer to pretty much anything derived from a plant or animal. And natural flavors can also include a variety of chemical additives, such as preservatives. The FDA doesn’t require companies to reveal what additional chemicals a specific item 35 .So if you want to know for certain what you’re getting with your groceries, you might want to stick to the farmer’s market.",
